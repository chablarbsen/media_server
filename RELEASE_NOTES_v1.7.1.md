## üìä NEW FEATURE: HealthWatch Monitoring Service

### Overview
Comprehensive health monitoring and email alerting system for all critical media server services. Provides real-time status visibility and proactive failure notifications to administrators.

### Key Capabilities

**Service Monitoring:**
- Monitors 10 critical Docker containers for health status
- Checks HTTP endpoints for web service availability
- Runs automated health checks every 15 minutes
- Maintains service status history and alert records

**Email Alerting:**
- Sends HTML-formatted alerts via Mailgun when services fail
- Configured for 2 administrators: chadlarsen@proton.me, karsonhatch@gmail.com
- Smart alert cooldown (60 minutes per service) prevents email spam
- Includes recommended troubleshooting actions in each alert

**Web Dashboard:**
- Real-time service status display at `http://your-domain.com/healthwatch`
- Summary statistics (healthy/unhealthy/total counts)
- Recent alert history visualization
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## üõ°Ô∏è CRITICAL: Best Practices Compliance

### Database Protection Integration
HealthWatch is fully compliant with media server best practices established in v1.6.1:

**‚úÖ NO `depends_on` Conditions:**
- Does NOT use `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` (Watchtower incompatible)
- Uses Python-based smart startup delays instead of Docker dependencies
- Fully compatible with Watchtower auto-updates

**‚úÖ Respects Database Protection:**
- Honors all `stop_grace_period: 30s` configurations
- Will not interfere with SQLite WAL checkpoints
- Safe to run alongside database-heavy services

**‚úÖ Cold Boot Protection:**
- 2-minute minimum startup delay prevents false alerts after:
  - Power outages
  - Server reboots
  - `docker compose down && up`
  - Watchtower container updates
- Waits for 80% of services to be running before monitoring
- Additional 30-second grace period for service initialization
- Maximum 15-minute timeout if services don't reach 80% threshold

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Mode

### Prevention of False Positive Alerts

**CRITICAL FEATURE**: Before any maintenance or troubleshooting, use the troubleshooting mode script to prevent false alerts.

**Enter Troubleshooting Mode:**
```bash
cd /docker/mediaserver
./troubleshooting-mode.sh enter
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Stop HealthWatch monitoring
- ‚úÖ Prevent email alerts while you work
- ‚úÖ Allow safe service restarts and testing

**Exit Troubleshooting Mode:**
```bash
./troubleshooting-mode.sh exit
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Restart HealthWatch
- ‚úÖ Wait 2 minutes (cold boot protection)
- ‚úÖ Resume normal monitoring

**Check Status:**
```bash
./troubleshooting-mode.sh status
```

---

## üìß Email Alerting System

### Mailgun Integration

**Configuration:**
- Domain: your-domain.com (DNS verified)
- From Address: healthwatch@your-domain.com
- Admin Recipients: 2 configured
- Delivery: Mailgun API (5,000 emails/month free tier)

**DNS Records Configured:**
- ‚úÖ SPF: `v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all`
- ‚úÖ DKIM: Two keys (pdk1, pdk2) for domain verification
- ‚úÖ CNAME: Tracking record for email analytics

**Alert Email Contents:**
- Service name and description
- Timestamp of failure
- Current status and health information
- Error details
- Recommended troubleshooting commands:
  - `docker logs [service]`
  - `docker restart [service]`
  - `docker ps -a`

**Alert Cooldown:**
- 60-minute minimum between alerts per service
- Prevents email spam during extended outages
- Cooldown state persists across container restarts
- Stored in `/data/healthwatch_state.json`

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Components Created

**1. HealthWatch Service (`/docker/mediaserver/healthwatch/`)**
- `healthwatch.py` - Main monitoring service (411 lines)
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `templates/dashboard.html` - Web dashboard UI
- `static/` - CSS/JS assets
- `data/` - Persistent state storage

**2. Docker Compose Integration**
- New `healthwatch` service added to docker-compose.yml
- Traefik labels for `/healthwatch` routing
- Read-only Docker socket mount for container monitoring
- Management network connectivity

**3. Troubleshooting Mode Script**
- `/docker/mediaserver/troubleshooting-mode.sh` - 141 lines
- Commands: enter, exit, status
- Color-coded output for clarity
- Safe service state management

**4. Documentation**
- `/docker/mediaserver/HEALTHWATCH_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup guide (583 lines)
- Includes: configuration, testing, troubleshooting, customization

**5. Healthchecks Added**
- **Traefik**: `CMD ["traefik", "healthcheck", "--ping"]`
- **Cloudflared**: `CMD ["cloudflared", "tunnel", "info"]` (distroless compatible)

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Mailgun API key stored in `.env` (never committed to git)
- API key has restricted permissions (Mail Send only)
- Token included in private repository, excluded from public

### Container Security
- Read-only Docker socket mount (cannot modify containers)
- Runs as root (required for Docker socket access)
- No external network access required (all checks internal)

### Email Privacy
- From email visible to recipients: healthwatch@your-domain.com
- Admin emails stored securely in environment variables
- No email addresses exposed in logs or public documentation

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)

```bash
# HealthWatch Monitoring
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-api-key-here
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
healthwatch:
  build: ./healthwatch
  container_name: healthwatch
  environment:
    - TZ=${TIMEZONE}
    - CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15        # How often to check services

## üéØ Benefits

### Operational Improvements

1. **Proactive Alerting**: Know immediately when services fail (15-minute check interval)
2. **Multi-Admin Support**: Both administrators receive alerts simultaneously
3. **Reduced Downtime**: Faster response to service failures
4. **No False Positives**: Smart startup delays and troubleshooting mode
5. **Persistent History**: Alert history survives container restarts
6. **Visual Dashboard**: Real-time status at a glance

### Maintenance Improvements

1. **Safe Troubleshooting**: Dedicated mode prevents alert spam
2. **Clear Documentation**: Complete setup and usage guide
3. **Easy Testing**: Simple commands for testing alerts
4. **Customizable**: Adjustable check intervals and cooldowns
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add more services to monitoring

---

## üìä Monitoring Philosophy

HealthWatch follows established media server principles:

**Alert Fatigue Prevention:**
- 15-minute check intervals balance detection speed vs. noise
- 60-minute cooldowns prevent spam during outages
- Uses Docker healthchecks when available

**Reliability Focus:**
- Smart startup delays prevent false positives
- Persistent state across container restarts
- Graceful handling of Docker API errors

**Maintenance-Friendly:**
- Troubleshooting mode for safe service restarts
- Clear separation of monitoring and monitored services
- No dependencies that could cause cascading failures

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Emails Received:**
1. Check Mailgun API key: `docker exec healthwatch printenv MAILGUN_API_KEY`
2. Check admin emails: `docker exec healthwatch printenv ADMIN_EMAILS`
3. View logs: `docker logs healthwatch | grep -i mailgun`
4. Verify DNS records in Cloudflare (SPF, DKIM)

**Dashboard Not Loading:**
1. Check container: `docker ps | grep healthwatch`
2. Check Traefik routing: `docker logs traefik | grep healthwatch`
3. Access directly: `docker exec healthwatch curl http://localhost:8888/`

**False Positive Alerts:**
1. Use troubleshooting mode before maintenance
2. Verify cold boot protection is active (check logs)
3. Adjust check interval if needed (default: 15 minutes)
