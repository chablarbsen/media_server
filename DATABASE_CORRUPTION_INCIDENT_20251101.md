# Database Corruption Incident - November 1, 2025

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Time:** 11:20 AM - 11:55 AM UTC
**Severity:** HIGH - Database Corruption
**Services Affected:** Sonarr, Radarr
**Root Cause:** Improper container restart procedure during partition resize

---

## Incident Summary

During partition resize operation, both Sonarr and Radarr databases became corrupted due to improper container restart sequence that violated documented procedures.

**Error Message:**
```
database disk image is malformed
NzbDrone.Core.Datastore.CorruptDatabaseException
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Happened

1. **11:19 AM**: Partition resize script (resize-partition.sh) reached Step 7 (restart containers)
2. **Script used:** `docker start $(docker ps -aq)` - starting ALL containers simultaneously
3. **Problem:** This violated documented Gluetun restart procedure in NETWORKING_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md
4. **Result:** Race condition during startup caused improper database shutdown
5. **Detection:** 11:35 AM - Database integrity check revealed corruption in both services

### Why It Happened

**Script Failure:**
- resize-partition.sh Step 7 used incorrect restart method
- Should have followed: Gluetun → wait 60s → SABnzbd/Deluge → wait 10s → Others
- Actually used: Start all containers at once

**Documentation Not Followed:**
- NETWORKING_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md lines 122-136 clearly document correct restart order
- Documentation was reviewed but not applied to script
- Same issue that caused DB corruption on Oct 17, 2025

### Technical Details

**SQLite Corruption Mechanism:**
- Services stopped without proper shutdown grace period
- Database had uncommitted WAL (Write-Ahead Log) transactions
- Improper termination left databases in inconsistent state
- SQLite integrity check would show "database disk image is malformed"

### Radarr
- **Status:** Corrupted database, service wouldn't start
- **Database:** `/docker/mediaserver/radarr/radarr.db`
- **Error:** `code = Corrupt (11), message = database disk image is malformed`

### Not Affected
- ✅ Plex: No corruption detected
- ✅ Prowlarr: No corruption detected
- ✅ Bazarr: No corruption detected
- ✅ Lidarr: No corruption detected
- ✅ Readarr: No corruption detected
- ✅ Immich: No corruption detected

---

## Recovery Actions Taken

### 1. Enter Troubleshooting Mode
```bash
docker stop healthwatch
# Troubleshooting mode: ACTIVE
```

### 2. Stop Corrupted Services
```bash
docker stop sonarr radarr
```

### 3. Backup Corrupted Databases
```bash
cp sonarr/sonarr.db sonarr/sonarr.db.corrupted-20251101-115052
cp radarr/radarr.db radarr/radarr.db.corrupted-20251101-115052
```

### 4. Restore from Backups

**Sonarr:**
- Source: `Backups/scheduled/sonarr_backup_v4.0.15.2941_2025.10.29_18.18.22.zip`
- Backup date: October 29, 2025 6:18 PM
- Data loss: 3 days

**Radarr:**
- Source: `Backups/scheduled/radarr_backup_v5.28.0.10274_2025.10.29_18.18.22.zip`
- Backup date: October 29, 2025 6:18 PM
- Data loss: 3 days

### 5. Restart Services
```bash
docker start sonarr radarr
```

### 6. Verify Recovery
- ✅ Sonarr: Responding to API calls
- ✅ Radarr: Responding to API calls, marked healthy
- ✅ No corruption errors in logs

### 7. Exit Troubleshooting Mode
```bash
docker start healthwatch
# Troubleshooting mode: ENDED
```

## Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 11:19 AM | Partition resize script starts Step 7 (restart containers) |
| 11:20 AM | Containers restarted with improper sequence |
| 11:22 AM | Deluge namespace error (fixed by recreating container) |
| 11:35 AM | User requested database integrity verification |
| 11:40 AM | Corruption detected in Sonarr and Radarr |
| 11:50 AM | Entered troubleshooting mode (after initial mistake) |
| 11:52 AM | Databases restored from Oct 29 backups |
| 11:53 AM | Services restarted successfully |
| 11:55 AM | Recovery verified, exited troubleshooting mode |

**Total Downtime:** ~35 minutes

## Data Loss Assessment

### Sonarr (3 days lost)
- Missing: Downloads/imports from Oct 29 - Nov 1
- Missing: Any series/episode additions during that period
- Missing: Quality profile or settings changes

### Radarr (3 days lost)
- Missing: Downloads/imports from Oct 29 - Nov 1
- Missing: Any movie additions during that period
- Missing: Quality profile or settings changes

### Mitigation
- Most media files still exist on disk
- Can trigger library rescans to re-associate existing files
- Active downloads in SABnzbd/Deluge unaffected

---

## Prevention Measures Implemented

### 1. Documentation Created
**New:** `/docker/mediaserver/CONTAINER_RESTART_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
- Consolidates restart procedures
- Emphasizes Gluetun dependency handling
- Mandatory reference for all restart operations

### 2. Safe Restart Script
**New:** `/docker/mediaserver/restart-containers-safely.sh`
- Implements correct Gluetun → wait → dependents order
- Includes health checks and verification
- To be used for all future restart operations

### 3. Fixed Resize Script
**Updated:** `/docker/mediaserver/resize-partition.sh`
- Step 7 now uses correct restart sequence
- Follows documented Gluetun procedure
- Tested and verified

### 4. Process Improvements
**Mandatory procedures:**
- ALWAYS review .md files before writing scripts
- ALWAYS enter troubleshooting mode before service maintenance
- ALWAYS follow documented restart order for Gluetun
- NEVER use `docker start $(docker ps -aq)` when Gluetun involved

---

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Mistakes Made

1. **Script didn't follow documentation**
   - NETWORKING_PERSISTENCE_GUIDE.md was reviewed but not applied
   - Wrote script with `docker start $(docker ps -aq)` instead of proper sequence
   - Same mistake that caused Oct 17 corruption

2. **Troubleshooting mode not used initially**
   - Stopped HealthWatch directly instead of entering troubleshooting mode first
   - Caused additional alert emails during recovery
   - Violated documented procedures TWICE in same session

3. **Verification not performed**
   - Should have checked database integrity immediately after resize
   - Caught corruption ~15 minutes later instead of immediately
   - User had to request verification

### What Should Have Happened

1. **Before resize:**
   - Review ALL .md files
   - Extract specific procedures to checklist
   - Write script following exact documented procedures
   - Test script logic before execution

2. **During resize Step 7:**
   ```bash
   # Correct order:
   docker compose up -d gluetun
   sleep 60
   docker compose up -d sabnzbd deluge
   sleep 10
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **After resize:**
   - Immediately verify database integrity
   - Check all service logs for errors
   - Enter troubleshooting mode for any fixes
   - Only exit troubleshooting mode after full verification
